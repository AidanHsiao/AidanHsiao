### ðŸ’» What I do:

statistics and assist you in-lobby. The website is written using React and Next.js, which are two frameworks I hope to master.
- I enjoy making portfolio websites for friends who need them.
- I make utility bots for <img src="https://logodownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/discord-logo-4-1.png" width="15" height="15"/> <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a>, with high proficiency in making API requests.

  ðŸ™‚ More about me:
</h3>
<p align="right">
I gained a passion for coding when I was 11 years old, starting with Scratch back in 6th grade. I slowly moved up the chain, going from Scratch, to basic Node.js, to HTML/CSS/JS, and finally Next.js + Typescript. <br><br>
I started learning React at the beginning of 2022, and have been obsessed with component-based frameworks. I'm hoping to learn other front-end frameworks like Vue and Angular, as well as utility frameworks such as Redux! <br><br>
